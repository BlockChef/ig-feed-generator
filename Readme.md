# Flowchart Overview

This flowchart represents the detailed architecture and workflow of the Automated Instagram Feed Posting system. It covers all key components, from user input to final post publishing, ensuring every step of the process is visualized.

## Flowchart Components and Workflow

### User
- **Description**: Users initiate the process by submitting content details through a form.
- **Flow**: The process begins with the user providing the necessary details.

### Input Details - Submit Form
- **Description**: This step involves submitting a form that includes the content, images, videos, and metadata.
- **Flow**: Once details are submitted, they move into the system for further processing.

### Data Collection & Storage
- **Description**: The submitted and fetched data are collected and stored in the system (likely in MongoDB).
- **Flow**: After storing the data, the system moves on to validating it.

### Validation Steps
- **Completeness Validation**: Checks that all required fields are filled out and no critical data is missing.
- **Consistency Validation**: Verifies that all metadata is consistent with the input content (e.g., captions match images/videos).
- **Flow**: The data passes through these validation steps sequentially.

### Generate Content
- **Description**: Using AI tools like ChatGPT, the system generates or refines the content based on the provided details.
- **Flow**: The generated content is then formatted and optimized in subsequent steps.

### Add Metadata
- **Description**: The system adds metadata, such as hashtags, geotags, and user mentions, to the content.
- **Flow**: Once the metadata is added, the content is ready for review.

### Review Content
- **Description**: A preview of the content is presented to the user for review. This step allows for final checks before scheduling.
- **Flow**: The content can either be approved directly or amended if necessary.

### Amend Content
- **Description**: If the content needs adjustments, the user can amend it. After amendments, the content is revalidated.
- **Flow**: Amended content flows back into the review process.

### Approval & Scheduling
- **Description**: Once reviewed and approved, the content is scheduled for posting at a specified time.
- **Flow**: The scheduling system sets the post time, and the content is queued for publishing.

### Schedule Post
- **Description**: The content is scheduled to be posted on Instagram at the designated time.
- **Flow**: Scheduled content is then published via the system.

### Post to Instagram
- **Description**: The system automatically posts the content to Instagram.
